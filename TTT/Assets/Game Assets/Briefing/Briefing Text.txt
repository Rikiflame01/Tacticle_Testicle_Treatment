Alright Chemoforce, your patient today is Greg Wilkinson, aged 19.
He’s been diagnosed with stage II testicular cancer.
That means it’s metastasized and is getting ready to spread all over the body.
Your job today is to go into his bloodstream, locate any runaway cancer cells, neutralise them and then get to his testes.
